            <p>
                The healthcare industry faces numerous challenges that impact patient outcomes and provider efficiency. Patients often struggle with complex scheduling systems, lack timely reminders, and experience delays in receiving test results. Healthcare providers, in turn, spend significant time on administrative tasks, detracting from patient care.
            </p>
            <p>
                ACME Inc.'s digital transformation aims to address these pain points by automating processes and creating a seamless experience for both patients and providers, ultimately improving operational efficiency and patient satisfaction.
