                VehiSure is an innovative automotive inspection application designed to streamline the inspection process
                for both inspectors and drivers. Through a blend of advanced diagnostic features, voice-enabled checklists, 
                and real-time reporting, VehiSure revolutionizes how inspections are conducted in the field. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal of this project was to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and user experience of the inspection process, 
                reducing paperwork and enabling faster decision-making through real-time data access.

            <p>
                The design process for VehiSure was rooted in understanding the challenges faced by vehicle inspectors. Through research, 
                we identified key pain points such as manual data entry, lack of real-time information, and inefficient reporting. 
                The design process followed a user-centered approach, starting with persona development, wireframing, and iterative user testing.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Research:</strong> Identified inspector pain points and goals through interviews and surveys.</li>
                <li><strong>Wireframing:</strong> Designed low-fidelity sketches to visualize the appâ€™s layout and core functionalities.</li>
                <li><strong>User Testing:</strong> Conducted multiple rounds of usability testing with inspectors to ensure ease of use.</li>
                <li><strong>Final Prototyping:</strong> Created a high-fidelity interactive prototype in Figma to showcase the final design.</li>
            </ul>

                Storyboarding was essential to visualize the entire inspection process, from login to reporting. This process ensured that 
                inspectors could navigate the app intuitively and complete tasks efficiently.
